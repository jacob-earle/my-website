# Implementation and Theory of Real-Time Scheduling

## Fall 2021 CPSC 490 Senior Project by Jacob Earle
Here you will find my submission for my 2021 Senior Project for the Math and Computer Science Major.
There are two coding projects that I have worked on for my senior project:

1. Implementing a real-time scheduling algorithm for a research operating system (code [here](https://github.com/theseus-os/Theseus/pull/492))
2. Command line tool for analyzing the feasibility of real-time task sets (code [here](https://github.com/jacob-earle/RealtimeDeadlineAnalysis))

The links to the source code for these projects will be available in the final report included below.
Below, you will find resources to learn more about my senior project:

1. [My original project proposal](/docs/Jacob_Earle_Senior_Project_Proposal.pdf)
2. [My final project report](/docs/Senior_Project_Report.pdf)
3. [Slide deck of theoretical results that I presented to the math department](/docs/JacobEarleSeniorPresentation.pdf)

My research was conducted at the Yale Efficient Computing lab under the advisory of Prof. Lin Zhong.
